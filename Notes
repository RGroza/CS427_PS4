Created new header files: Board.hpp, Pit.hpp, and Player.hpp

Board.hpp:
    - Implemented Board class:
        - Created unique_ptr to manage "pitWarehouse" which contains an array of Pit objects
        - Created "north" and "south" Player objects
        - Board() constructor fills in the entries of the "pitWarehouse" array, starting from
          the last south house "S<numHouses>" and ending at the north store "N0"
        - While constructing the array, each Pit object in the array is linked to the correct
          "next" and "opposite" pointers using the references to their respective array entries
        - The operator<< function prints the Board "pitWarehouse" entries in order, by calling
          each Pit object's operator<<.

Pit.hpp:
    - Implemented Pit class:
        - Contains owner Player object, number, label, and pointers to next and opposite Pit objects
        - Default constructor creates a temporary Pit object with uninitialized values
        - Explicit constructor assigns the parameter values to their respective private members
        - The operator<< function prints the Pit label along with the labels of the next and opposite
          Pit objects using the pointers (if they exist). If either Pit does not exist, then it
          prints " = nullptr"
        - The class member for the number of seeds is not defined yet but will be in the future

Player.hpp:
    - Defined enum class Side to indicate either "Side::North" or "Side:South"
    - Implemented Player struct:
        - Contains members for Player side, name string, and label character
        - Explicit constructor used to assign parameter values to members
        - otherSide() function returns the Side enum value of the opposite side
